This session I plan to implement the expression prompt and handling the input
- The program will first prompt the user for a valid expression. If the expression is invalid, it will throw an error.
- Once the program receives a valid expression it will then parse it and add each operation and digit to a list for calculation in the order they are provided. The parsing will check for optional whitespace and whether or not the digit is an integer.
